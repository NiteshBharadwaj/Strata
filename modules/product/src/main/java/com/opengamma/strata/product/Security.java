 * A security that can be traded.
 * <p>
 * A security is one of the building blocks of finance, representing a fungible instrument that can be traded.
 * This is intended to cover instruments such as listed equities, bonds and exchange traded derivatives (ETD).
 * Within Strata, a financial instrument is a security if it is a standardized
 * exchange-based contract that can be referenced by a {@link SecurityId}.
 * The security can be looked up in {@link ReferenceData} using the identifier.
 * <p>
 * It is intended that Over-The-Counter (OTC) instruments, such as an interest rate swap,
 * are embedded directly within the trade, rather than handled as one-off securities.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be immutable beans.
